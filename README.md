# Ar Kit

* Integrate iOS device camera and motion features to produce augmented reality experiences in your app or game.
* Augmented reality (AR) describes user experiences that add 2D or 3D elements to the live view from a device's camera in a way that makes those elements appear to inhabit the real world. ARKit combines device motion tracking, camera scene capture, advanced scene processing, and display conveniences to simplify the task of building an AR experience. You can create many kinds of AR experiences with these technologies using the front or rear camera of an iOS device.

# Scene Kit

* 3D SceneKit content drawn as a flattened sprite.
* Use SK3DNode objects to incorporate 3D SceneKit content into a SpriteKit-based game. When SpriteKit renders the node, the SceneKit scene is animated and rendered first. Then this rendered image is composited into the SpriteKit scene. Use the scnScene property to specify the SceneKit scene to be rendered.
